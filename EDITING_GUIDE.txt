FULL JSON EDIT MODE

You can now edit ALL content using JSON files:

Global:
- content/site.json

Per page:
- content/index.json
- content/product.json
- content/solutions.json
- content/dental.json
- content/pricing.json
- content/resources.json
- content/company.json
- content/contact.json

After editing any JSON, commit changes and GitHub Pages updates automatically.

Notes:
- Some buttons/links (URLs) remain in HTML. If you need those editable too, tell me and I will add link fields to JSON.
